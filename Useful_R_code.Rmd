## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
x <- c(sample(1:10, replace=F))
y <- c(sample(1:10, replace=F))
gene1 <- c(sample(1:20, 10, replace=F))

Input_Data = data.frame(x,y, gene1)
new_df = sapply(1:3, function(j) {
  return(Input_Data[sample(1:10, 
                                  replace = FALSE), 
                           1 + 2])
  })
new_df
```
